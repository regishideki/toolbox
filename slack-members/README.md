# Slack Members
Retrieves all members from a slack channel and returns it in CSV format.

## Context
I wanted to segment mailing list based on Slack Channel members. I did not find a simple solution to fetch members list from a Slack Channel or a Group. So I wrote a small script called `membersof.rb` what extract a csv formatted list.

## Requirements
### Ruby with Standard Library
You can use several tools to install Ruby. Check it out at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

### Slack Tocken
You can generate or find your personal Slack token here: https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens

### Slack Channel or Group ID
You can either call [channels.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list) to get the list of all channels and to convert the channel name to its ID.
Or.
On Slack Web interface the link to Channels or Groups contains the ID

## Run
```
$ ./membersof.rb --help
